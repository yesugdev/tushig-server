# You can use your own textured item models with following format:
# CustomModel[<itemName>]{<ID>}
# Example: daily-available-item: CustomModel[PAPER]{1010}
#
# Plugin also supports Oraxen's & ItemsAdder's custom
# items, simply put the item's name from Oraxen's config
# Example: daily-available-item: "storm_sword"
#
# You can also use textured head with base64 value
# instead the item type in configuration
# Example: daily-available-item: "eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvMjk5NjMzNzhmZmViZWM0MjBmNGM4YTU4YWQ2OTZhMTUxOGQ1N2VjNTZmOTA2OWU1YzkyMGQ2M2Q1ZWU0ZWZmMyJ9fX0="
#
# NOTE THAT ITEM & SOUND NAMES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN >1.12 & 1.13< VERSIONS!
# SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING VALID ITEM NAMES (DEFAULT ONE ARE USED FROM 1.13+ VERSIONS)
# OTHERWISE WILL BE REPLACED BY STONE IF INVALID NAME IS IN USE.
